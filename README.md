# PyTools

Welcome to my PyTools repository.
These are just some stuff i've been making to practice since i'm studying Python.
Feel free to use code as you like.

## Tool List:

### 1. **YT-2-File**:
This is a Youtube to MP4 downloader.

Using this tool you will be able to:
- Download all **public** videos of a channel.
- Download all videos of a **public or not-listed** playlist. **(Not working)**
- Download a **public or not-listed** video.
- Make a search in youtube by title and choose from top results.

### 2. **YT-2-MP3**:
This is a Youtube to MP3 downloader.

Using this tool you will be able to:
- Download all **public** videos of a channel.
- Download all videos of a **public or not-listed** playlist. **(Not working)**
- Download a **public or not-listed** video.
- Make a search in youtube by title and choose from top results.

## Executables
All executables are inside ``[module folder]\dist``.<br>
I've tried to make relative shorcuts, but for some reason they stop working when uploaded.

## Requirements

To run **py files** correctly **you will need to install these modules**:

- [PyTube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)

## How to Install modules:

In your terminal write:
``pip install [module name]``
