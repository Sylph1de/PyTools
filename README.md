# PyTools

Welcome to my PyTools repository.
These are just some stuff i've been making to practice since i'm studying Python.
Feel free to use code as you like.

## Tool List:

### **S-Tube**:
This is a Youtube to MP3/MP4 downloader.

Using this tool you will be able to:
- Download a **public or not-listed** video.

## Executables

If you want the tools as executables, you can get them at [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/20dCyCQJ#U4MzYego-kOBQYDLn1ynMQ).

Executables are inside ``[module folder]\dist`` folder.<br>
I've tried to add a Shortcut, but it brokes when files are compressed, so if you need one just make it.
